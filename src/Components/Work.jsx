        <p>
          I worked in this company for 4 months. <br />
          It was a team project (10 developers) and we developed an app using React for the front and Express for the back. <br/>
          MongoDB was also used to create the database. <br />
          Other tools used in this project: Postman, Git, Github, Slack.
